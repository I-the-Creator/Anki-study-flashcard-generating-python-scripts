Question,Answer
What is the total magnification and field of view when using a light microscope to observe cells?,The total magnification is calculated by multiplying the magnification of each objective lens. The field of view (FOV) is the area that can be seen through the microscope at a given magnification.
What are the parts of a microscope?,"A microscope typically has several parts including the body, eyepiece, objective lenses, stage, diaphragm, and focus knobs."
How do you calculate the magnification of each objective lens?,The magnification of each objective lens can be calculated by dividing the focal length of the objective lens by the focal length of the eyepiece.
How do you calculate the field of view at different magnifications?,The field of view at different magnifications can be calculated by dividing the diameter of the field of view at a lower magnification by the magnification of the objective lens.
How do you use FOV to calculate size of specimen?,"To calculate the size of a specimen using FOV, first determine how many times the object fits across the FOV. Then divide this number by the FOV."
What are organelles and what do they do?,Organelles are structures within a cell that perform specific functions and biochemical processes like controlling cell growth and producing energy. These biochemical processes are controlled and regulated by a series of specific enzymes. Plant and animal cells can contain similar types of organelles.
Which organelle is responsible for photosynthesis?,Chloroplasts
Which organelle is responsible for cellular respiration?,Mitochondria
Which organelle synthesizes complex molecules including proteins?,Ribosomes
"Which organelle synthesizes carbohydrates, lipids and steroids?",Endoplasmic reticulum
Which organelle is responsible for manufacturing and storing of food?,Vacuoles
Which organelle is responsible for the removal of cellular products and wastes?,Lysosomes
